### Assignments:
- HW1: Scatter Plots

  - My goal is to implement a web-based scatter plot to show the iris dataset by using D3.
  - Users can determine the x-axis (and y-axis) to show the values of one of the attributes, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, when interacting with the tool.
  -  Render scatter points in different colors to represent three different flower classes.

- HW2: Parallel Coordinate Plots

  - Users can change the order of the axes.
  - The axes are four different attributes such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
  - Render poly-lines (flower samples: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor and Iris virginica) in different hues to represent three different flower classes.
